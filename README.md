# Cherry's Cities Skylines Controller Mod
An Xinput integration mod for Cities Skylines on the PC that aims to recreate the control scheme and UI flow found in the console ports.

# Installation notes
- http://www.citiesmods.com/how-to-install-mods/
- Currently requires XInputInterface.dll from https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet to be placed next to Cities.exe to work (this might change later)
- Developed using an Xbox One S controller, playtested on Steam Deck.

# If you're actually going to try this thing
- Still a super early version. I can't recommend using the mod for general gameplay yet, although you do have full camera control and can navigate the main tool strip and place roads, buildings, objects, assign zones districts. 
- Somewhat playable on the Steam Deck via the trackpad mouse preset.
- The current iteration has an "inspect mode" just like on console. When the game loads, you start in this mode. Press DPAD Right to start hovering over the main toolstrip. Same flow as on console from there.
- Return to menu and reload your game when unlocking a new item in the main toolstrip, otherwise you can't select it (will be reworking that bit later)
- You can adjust camera control sensitivity in settings (position, hover, zoom). This is for debug only atm, will lose parameters after leaving the session.
